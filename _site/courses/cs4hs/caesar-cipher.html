  <h1 id="caesar-cipher">Caesar Cipher</h1>

  <p>This cipher matches each letter of the alphabet with another letter by shifting the alignment by a set number of places. A Caesar cipher is traditionally shifted by 3 places, but the same concept can be applied for a shift of any number of places.</p>

  <p><strong>For a shift of 3:</strong><br />
a becomes d<br />
b becomes e<br />
c becomes f<br />
x becomes a<br />
y becomes b<br />
z becomes c</p>

    <p>Here are a few activities to practice the Caesar cipher. You may want to use the alphabet reference to figure out the enciphered letters.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Encipher the word <strong>axolotl</strong> using a shift of <strong>3</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Decipher the phrase <strong>rk wkh kxjh pdqdwhh</strong> which was encoded using a shift of <strong>3</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Choose a shift that is <strong>not 3</strong> and encipher the name of your favourite movie.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Pass your enciphered movie name to a friend and tell them the shift so they can decode it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Could you figure out an Caesar-enciphered message without knowing the shift? Explain.</p>
