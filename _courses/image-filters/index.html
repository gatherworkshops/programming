Explore intermediate coding concepts by programming an image filter you can apply to any photograph, like in the famous Instagram app. 

The filter will be coded using Python 3 and you will have the option to customise your filter and design a unique outcome. We will explore how loops and basic mathematics (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) can be used to manipulate images. 

This course is suitable for those with prior text-based programming experience. You must be familiar with variables and text-based code structure. Familiarity with loops and conditional statements will be helpful but not necessary.

Requirements:

- Input and output
- Indexed data structure
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- DRY principle
- Logical decomposition 

Achieved
- Implement a plan
- Clear structure
- Comments
- Test and debug expected cases

Merit
- Variable scope
- Parameters for modules
- Comments which explain
- Test and debug boundary cases

Excellence
- Constants
- Derived values
- Comments which explain and justify
- Test and debug on invalid inputs
