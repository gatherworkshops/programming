      Welcome to Electronics with Arduino!

      This taster is designed to introduce you to the basics of sensor input and real-world output using Arduino.

      By the end of the workshop you will have built and coded a selection of small electronics demo projects.

    notes: |

      Your mentors are super friendly, make sure to say hi.

      They actually get paid to do this stuff for a job, which is super cool.

      You can ask them for help with your code, ask them about their day job, or ask them what their favourite colour is.

      They're here to help, so ask them anything :)

      ## Say hi to your mentors!

      Your mentors are here to help if you get stuck,
      and you can ask them (almost) anything!

      Let's quickly go around the room and introduce ourselves.

      Tell us all one of your favourite things - favourite food, sport, hobby, animal, anything!

      If you could choose one super power, which would it be?

      Last of all, tell us your name.

  - title: schedule

    notes: |
      Today's workshop is arranged in six different sections.

      In the first part we will look at how the Internet works and what this means for us as coders, plus take a look at the basics of web code languages.

      After that we will start working on our own websites, so think about a topic! We will design a page layout and a menu bar.

      Later we will add some fancy extras to our site, like YouTube videos and a gallery.
